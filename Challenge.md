Here are my thoughts and consideration about the implementation

## Security Concerns
- I would like to host my images in a private repo, this helps in control of the images and Vulnerabilities
- Setup network policy for pod - pod communication between s3www and minio
- 


## Log management
- I would suggest implementation of logging tools (e.g stackdriver)


## Monitoring and Observability
- We should setup proper documentation for machine and business metrics, so this can be differentiated on the dashboard
- Proper documentation for Alerting rules, I might introduce obervability infra and On call features to manage downtime and incidents

## backup and disaster recovery
- Regular backup of Minio data, maybe to s3 Glacier or something less expensive.

## Cost Optimization
- Since we are going to be maintaining different env, I would suggest we have 1 cluster for QA and DEV separated by Namespace

##  Deployment and Release 
- I will propose Github Action for Terraform deployment and using GCP object storage to persist terraform state
- 

## CICD implementation
- I would have the following steps in my integration
-- Linting 
-- Security gate : We can check dockerfiles that are using public base image, Static code scanning for vulneranibilities, introduce OPA to help with the policy management
- This suggestion is debatable: I would suggest we run a PoC on any of the release tool e.g ArgoCD this helps integrate better with k8s cluster

## Networking
- 


Technical Debt
There are somethings that needs improvement in this arhitecture
- Helm Versioning : This will be covered in the CICD script actually, to help in rollback and proper versioning and production promotion
- Introduce HPA to manage pods and also manage resources
- My other concern is also on k8s version upgrade, which I believe if this is properly managed on Terraform, k8s upgrade should not be an issue
